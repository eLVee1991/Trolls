# TROLLS
Use this script to troll someones mouse. It will move the mouse a random number of times between 100 and a 1000 times. And display a message the user has to click away. Then the script moves the mouse to random location on the screen.

Have fun by creating your own installer script with py2app or pyinstaller! ;)

## How to run
Run the following command in your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/eLVee1991/Trolls.git

pip(3) install -r requirements.txt (for OSX only)

python(3) mousemover.py

## Modules
It needs the following modules on python for other OSX.

.Windows:

pip install pyautogui

.Linux:

pip3 install python3-xlib && sudo apt-get install scrot && sudo apt-get install python3-tk && sudo apt-get install python3-dev && pip3 install pyautogui


I will create a new script that will install all the dependencies soon!!
